HashMap, LinkedHashMap and TreeMap are all key-value data structures in Java.
HashMap : The order of elements does not follow a certain order and works faster than others. Time complexity is O(1).
LinkedHashMap : The order of elements is controlled, but the speed is poor compared to HashMap.
TreeMap : Maintains order of elements based on Comparator, time complexity is O(log n).


HashSet, LinkedHashSet and TreeSet are all three data structures used to store non-repeating elements in Java.
HashSet : The array of elements does not follow a specific order and works faster than others. Time complexity is O(1).
LinkedHashSet : The order of elements is controlled, but the speed is poor compared to HashMap.
TreeSet : Stores the order of elements based on Comparator, time complexity is O(log n).
