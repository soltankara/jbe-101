First we create str1 with "Hello" value. Then we create second object str2 with "Hello" value. str1
and str2 reference to same value in heap. That is why when we compare them we get true. But, str3 created
by using new keyword. It means java will create new value though we already have this value in heap. So
str1 and str3 don't reference to same value.
