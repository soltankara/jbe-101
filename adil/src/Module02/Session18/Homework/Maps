1.  HashMap vs LinkedHashMap vs TreeMap:

--  LinkedHashMap contains hashmap and doubly linked list which holds elements. This implementation store elements
    according to their insertion order. But linkedHashmap takes more memory than hashMap, because it keeps linkedList
    additionally.

--  TreeMap contains elements according to sorted keys.
