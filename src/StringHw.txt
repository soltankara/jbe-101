When we input two string literals, we can use "==" operator to compare them
and see if they are equal or not and with this way we compare the memory address
of them and both takes same references,but when we create instance using the
"new" keyword we basically create an object which stores in the heap memory so
that it can`t be compared with string literals even though if the given strings
are equal in the literal way.
