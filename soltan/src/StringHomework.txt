String str1 = "Hello";
String str2 = "Hello";
String str3 = new String("Hello");

System.out.println(str1==str2); //true
System.out.println(str1==str3); //false

Why?
----------------------------------------------------
Simple answer: They do not point to the same string.

Extended answer: Strings are immutable and when they are being initialized, they are being added to String Pool.
                 When two same text is being created without "new" keyword, program points them to the same String.
                 If we explicitly use "new" keyword, program creates another string for that.



   String Pool and pointings:

                 str1 --- > Hello
                             ^
                            /
                          /
                        /
                 str2 /


                 str3 --- > Hello
